DISCONTINUED!!! See [Kernelua](https://github.com/Penguin-Spy/kernelua) for my latest OS project.

# CheeseOS
An operating system written in C with the goal of simplifying how you access all of your files across all of your devices.  

yeah this repository never actually got the files committed to it. it was going to be an x86_64 UEFI operating system, but i was never able to figure out the OS loader. i got a memory map and stuff, but i didn't really understand C so i couldn't exit the loader stage.
